#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/GURoPjtlOGg
#### TodoTimer is a Flask web app that combines the convenience of a task-tracking app and timer at the same time. Harness your productivity and track your completed todos with TodoTimer!

#### This is my final project for Harvard CS50x 2021 and Codecademy's Flask Skill Path. Coded in Python, SQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

#### If you want to try out the app, here is the Heroku link: https://polar-badlands-84660.herokuapp.com/register

#### I implemented an index page that has a todo section on the top, where a user can add, delete, and mark todos as "completed", and a timer on the button where the user can set a timer ranging from 1 second to 1 day. Upon completion, the selected "Completion Tone" will loop until the user presses one of the three timer buttons. Ensuring that the completion tone would loop properly on mobile devices even with a locked screen was tricky but I managed to figure it out. There is also a "Completions" page wherein users can see their completed todos and respective dates of creation and completion.
